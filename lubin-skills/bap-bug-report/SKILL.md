  Deeply analyse a bug or feature request in the Bap repo
  (the-agentic-company/bap). Investigation is **mandatory and exhaustive**:
  Step 3 fans out 5 parallel subagents (Agent tool, general-purpose / Explore)
  over symptom-to-root-cause walk, caller graph, adjacent implementations,
  test contract, and git history before any code is written. Step 4
  enumerates 2 to 3 grounded alternatives and picks the one that
  minimises new code (reuse existing abstractions, no new files,
  additive over contract-modifying). Then implements the smallest fix
  on a branch, opens a Pull Request, and creates a Linear ticket in
  team `Bap` (key BAP) at status `In Review`, labelled `Bug` (or
  `Feature`) + `Dogfooding`, assigned to the operator (Lubin), with the
  PR attached as a link. Then posts a structured message in Slack `#dev`
  with the original problem, the fix applied, and an `@Baptiste` ping
  asking for review. Use when the user
  describes a bug or feature gap in Bap / HeyBap (chat, coworker output,
  attachments, MCP, skills UI, run flow…) and wants the best-shaped fix
  proposed as a PR + a tracked Linear ticket without manual copy-paste.
  Triggers: "Bug: …", "Feature: …", "ouvre un ticket pour …",
  "open a PR for …", "audit the bug …".
  **Do not invoke directly.** This skill is a leaf of the Phase 2 dispatch.
  Route through `feature-bug-complexity-classification` (or the `/phase-2`
  slash command, or `scripts/submit-finding.sh`). Direct invocation skips
  the dedup pass (60-day Linear search, open-PR scan) and the
  classification grid (SIMPLE vs COMPLEX-SCOPED vs COMPLEX-FUZZY), which
  silently produces duplicate tickets and wrong routing. The only exception
  is an explicit operator override.

# Bap bug / feature → PR + Linear ticket

Goal: the user gives a short one-line bug or feature description; you investigate the Bap codebase in depth; you **create a Linear ticket in team `Bap` first to obtain its identifier (e.g. `BAP-123`), then implement the fix on a branch in `the-agentic-company/bap`, open a Pull Request that references the ticket identifier in its title, and update the Linear ticket to status `In Review` with the PR attached as a link**.

The Linear ticket is the durable report. A follow-up `#dev` Slack message restates the problem, summarises the fix, and pings Baptiste so the review request lands in his Slack inbox (the surface he watches).

## Repo & context (always)

- GitHub: https://github.com/the-agentic-company/bap
- Owner: `the-agentic-company`.
- CTO: Baptiste. The user (Lubin) is Chief of Staff at Hyperstack/CmdClaw and uses Bap heavily as a power user.
- Linear team: **Bap** (key `BAP`), workspace `heybap` (https://linear.app/heybap).
- Codebase layout (monorepo):
  - `apps/web/` — Next.js frontend (chat, coworker UIs, prompt bar, attachments, settings).
  - `packages/core/` — server services (sandbox, file service, orpc routers like `generation.startGeneration`, `coworker.trigger`).
  - Two recurring UI surfaces matter and are often asymmetric:
    1. **Chat panel** (`apps/web/src/components/chat/…`).
    2. **Coworker run output** (`apps/web/src/routes/agents/-components/coworker-info-panels.tsx`) + the prototype variant `apps/web/src/routes/prototype/coworker/info/-components/coworker-info-prototype.tsx`.
  - MIME validation for skill / coworker documents: `apps/web/src/server/storage/validation.ts` (separate from chat attachments).
  - Sandbox file limit: `packages/core/src/server/services/sandbox-file-service.ts`.
- PR conventions on this repo (look at recent merged PRs to confirm):
  - Title format: `<Area>: <verb> <object>` (e.g. `Web: fix coworker builder chat scrolling`, `Sandbox: fix coworker APP_URL sync`, `Skills: enable imports by default`). With this skill the title is prefixed with the Linear identifier: `BAP-123 Web: fix coworker builder chat scrolling`.
  - Branch format: `fix/<slug>` for bugs, `feat/<slug>` for features, with the Linear identifier in the slug: `fix/bap-123-chat-scrolling`. Linear's GitHub integration auto-detects either form.
  - Default branch is `main`.

## Step 1 — get a fresh local clone

Check first whether a recent clone already exists:

```bash
ls -d /tmp/bap-* 2>/dev/null
```

If yes, `cd` in and `git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull`. Otherwise:

```bash
gh repo clone the-agentic-company/bap /tmp/bap-bug-$(date +%s)
```

The local clone is mandatory: this skill writes a fix on a branch and pushes it.

## Step 2 — reproduce in the live product (Playwright, when relevant)

For any UI / UX / layout / interaction / visual bug, **reproduce the issue live and capture a "before" screenshot before concluding**. Static code reading alone misses half the picture (overflow, z-index, layout collapse, hover states, transition glitches, race conditions on load).

Use Playwright (already installed in `apps/web` as `@playwright/test`). The dev stack must be up; if it is not, restart it (`docker compose -f docker/compose/dev.yml up -d` then `bun run dev` from the repo root) and wait for `localhost:3000` to respond.

Capture the **BEFORE** screenshot on the broken state — checkout `main` (or the branch where the bug reproduces), navigate to the affected surface, take a screenshot, save it to `~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/before.png`. Naming matters: Step 6 uploads this file as `before.png` to Linear; downstream skills read it from there.

Minimal Playwright snippet (run from `apps/web/`):

```ts
// scripts/bug-report-capture.ts (created ad-hoc and deleted after run)
import { chromium } from "@playwright/test"
const url = "http://localhost:3000/agents/info/<slug>"  // path that reproduces the bug
const out = "/Users/lubin.danilo/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/before.png"
const browser = await chromium.launch()
const ctx = await browser.newContext({ storageState: "storage-state.json" })  // pre-authed session
const page = await ctx.newPage()
await page.goto(url)
await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle")
await page.screenshot({ path: out, fullPage: true })
await browser.close()
```

Use the existing auth fixture (`apps/web/tests/e2e/fixtures/*` or the project's `storage-state.json`) so the page lands authenticated. Capture 1 to 3 screenshots: one wide shot, one zoomed on the broken element, one of the working baseline if useful.

Also probe `page.evaluate(...)`, `page.on("console", ...)`, and `page.on("requestfailed", ...)` to catch silent errors, 4xx/5xx, unexpected payloads — equivalent of Chrome MCP's `read_console_messages` and `read_network_requests`.

The **AFTER** screenshot is captured in Step 7.5 once the fix is implemented.

Save every screenshot path into `evidence.screenshots` and tag each one as `kind: "before" | "after" | "context"` — Step 6 attaches them directly to the Linear ticket and Step 10 references the AFTER URL in the Slack post.

Skip Playwright reproduction only for purely backend / non-visual bugs. Justify the skip in one line in the ticket description.

The visual evidence refines the diagnosis. It does not replace the code-level root cause.

## Step 3 — deep codebase research (mandatory, fan out before fixing)

**Non-negotiable.** Picking the first plausible fix and shipping is the failure mode this step exists to prevent. The goal is to find the *best* way to fix the bug or build the feature, with the smallest blast radius and zero new regressions. The first idea is rarely the best one; the codebase usually contains an existing pattern that fits and reusing it beats inventing a new one.

Run this step in **parallel** via the Agent tool. Launch the angles below as separate subagents in a single message (one `general-purpose` or `Explore` agent per angle, briefed self-contained). Each subagent returns a structured report with `file:line` evidence for every claim. The skill aggregates the reports and only then proceeds to Step 4.

### Mandatory angles (each is one subagent)

1. **Symptom → root cause walk.** Start at the symptom (the file the user sees breaking, the failing log line, the missing toast). Trace **backwards** through the call graph until you reach a function whose return value or side effect *fully explains* the symptom. Stop at "this is the line that does it", not at "this looks suspicious". Output: an ordered chain of `file:line` references from symptom to root cause, each with one sentence on what it does.

2. **Caller graph of the change site.** Find every place that calls the function / reads the constant / depends on the behaviour you are about to change. Use `rg`, `ast-grep` if installed, or LSP if Bap is open in an editor. For each caller, note whether the proposed change would break its current contract. **A fix that updates one site and breaks three others is not a fix.**

3. **Adjacent implementations.** Find 2 to 3 places in the same repo where a *similar problem was already solved* (similar shape, different domain). Examples: another orpc router that solves the same validation pattern, another component that already wires the missing listener, another service that already handles the size limit you are about to lift. These are the templates. If none exists, say so explicitly; that is itself a signal that the change is novel.

4. **Test contract.** List every test file under `apps/*/test/`, `packages/*/test/`, `__tests__/`, or matching `*.spec.*` / `*.test.*` that touches the change site or one of its callers. For each, summarise in one line *what behaviour it locks in*. The fix must keep every existing test green; if a test must change, that is a signal of contract change and belongs in the PR body. If the area has zero test coverage, flag it.

5. **History lens (`git log` + `git blame`).** Why does the code look the way it does today? Run `git log --oneline -10 -- <change-site>` and `git blame <change-site>` on the offending line. If a recent commit introduced the symptom, name it. If the code was deliberately written this way (a known constraint, a TODO comment, a related PR description), respect that intent or call it out before overriding it.

Run angles 1-5 **concurrently** in a single Agent tool call message (5 subagent invocations in parallel). Wait for all to return before proceeding. If any angle returns "nothing found", do not silently skip; record it explicitly so Step 4 knows what evidence is missing.

### Synthesise (after subagents return)

Produce three things, in this order:

- **Root cause statement**: one paragraph, file:line anchored, derived from angle 1 + angle 5.
- **Constraints map**: what the fix MUST preserve (test contract, caller assumptions, deliberate prior design choices from angle 5). One bullet each.
- **Pattern match**: is there an existing adjacent implementation (angle 3) the fix can reuse? Name it. If yes, the fix is a *replication / extension*; if no, the fix is *novel* and you must justify why no existing pattern fits.

### Systematic coverage check (still required, in addition to the angles above)

1. Frontend filters / validation — `accept=`, MIME whitelists, size caps, silent `.filter(...)` drops, dropzone configs.
2. Client → server boundary — orpc routers, payload serialization (`dataUrl` base64 in JSON body is a known cost center).
3. Server services — sandbox limits, storage validation.
4. Surface asymmetry (chat vs coworker, prod vs prototype) — Bap's most common bug shape.
5. UX feedback — silent drops with no toast / error.
6. **DO NOT assume Vercel, S3, Cloudflare, etc.** Bap is **not** on Vercel. Frame body-limit / runtime claims as "any host body limit", not vendor-specific.

## Step 4 — design the fix, honestly (alternatives mandatory, simplest wins)

Before committing to a fix, **enumerate 2 to 3 alternative approaches** grounded in the research from Step 3. Each alternative must:

- Be technically possible given the constraints map.
- Touch a different surface or use a different abstraction (so the comparison is real, not cosmetic).
- Carry an honest trade-off line: what does it cost that the others do not (lines, surfaces touched, test churn, regression risk, performance, learning curve for the next person reading it).

Pick the alternative that **minimises new code while resolving the root cause**, preferring:

- Reusing an existing abstraction from Step 3 angle 3 over inventing a new one.
- Editing one site over editing two (when the constraints map allows).
- Lifting a constant or wiring a missing listener over restructuring a module.
- A change whose every caller (Step 3 angle 2) keeps the same contract over a change that requires updating callers.

**Anti-complexification rules** (apply to every fix, no exceptions):

- No new abstraction (function, hook, service, type) unless an existing one demonstrably cannot be reused.
- No new file unless the existing files cannot host the change.
- No defensive code for cases that cannot happen given the call graph (Step 3 angle 2). Trust the boundaries you traced.
- No comments explaining the bug in the code itself; the Linear ticket and PR body own that.
- No unrelated cleanup. The diff is for the bug at hand, not for the codebase at large.
- No "while I am here" refactor. Open a separate ticket for it if the urge is real.

Produce:

- **Quick fix** (the 10-minute unblock). This is what the PR will implement. Often: raise a constant, replace a silent `.filter()` with a toast, add a missing listener, copy a hook from the working surface to the broken one.
- **Durable fix** (the structural property). Goes in the Linear ticket as a follow-up note, not as code. Describe the **property** the fix should have, not a specific transport / vendor.
- **Alternatives considered**: 2-3 bullets from the enumeration above, one line each + the trade-off + why you didn't pick it.
- **Implications**: which other surfaces / hooks / constants get touched, migration concerns, data impact.
- **Regression risk**: for each caller from Step 3 angle 2, one line stating "no change to contract" or "contract changes in this way; mitigated by …". If any caller is *not* covered by an existing test, flag it as `test gap`.

## Step 5 — dedup check (mandatory, before any side effect)

Two checks, both required. The router may have done a first pass, but redo them here with the post-investigation knowledge.

**a) Linear `Bap` team** for an open ticket on the same root cause (60-day window):

```
mcp__linear__list_issues({
  team: "BAP",
  query: "<distinctive token, e.g. file path or symbol>",
  createdAt: "-P60D",
  limit: 50,
  includeArchived: false
})
```

Run 2 or 3 queries with different tokens. Ignore tickets in status `Canceled` or `Duplicate`. If a clear duplicate exists, **stop here**: do not open a PR, do not create a new ticket. Return to the caller with `Already covered by: BAP-<n> <ticket URL>` and the draft you would have shipped, so the user can comment on the existing ticket.

**b) Open PRs on the bap repo** touching the same files or symptom:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --search "<keyword>" --json number,title,headRefName,url
```

Run with 2-3 keyword variants (file path, symbol name, symptom noun). If a clear duplicate PR exists, check whether it already has a `BAP-` identifier in its title; if yes, **stop** and return that identifier + PR URL. If no, the next step will create the Linear ticket and you should comment on the existing PR with the new ticket identifier instead of opening a second PR.

Borderline (one shared keyword, different root cause) → continue; mention the related ticket / PR in the new ticket description.

Never silently skip. Never create a duplicate.

## Step 6 — create the Linear ticket

The ticket is created **before** the branch and PR so its identifier can be embedded in branch name + PR title and Linear's GitHub integration auto-attaches the PR.

```
mcp__linear__save_issue({
  team: "BAP",
  title: "<Area>: <verb> <object>",                       // PR-style, < 70 chars, no em-dash
  description: "<see ticket body template below>",
  state: "<config.linear.statuses.triage>",               // start at Triage; Step 9 transitions to In Review
  labels: [
    "<config.linear.labels.bug | .feature>",
    "<config.linear.labels.dogfooding>",                  // every FDE-surfaced finding
    "<config.linear.labels.ui_ux>"                        // only if the finding lives in the UI
  ],
  assignee: "<config.linear.default_assignee_user_id>",   // Lubin for SIMPLE
  priority: 3                                             // 0=None 1=Urgent 2=High 3=Medium 4=Low; default 3
})
```

**Ticket body template** (markdown, French ok since the team is French):

```markdown
## Symptôme
<une ligne : ce que voit l'utilisateur>

## Cause racine
<2-4 lignes, ancrées sur file:line, chaîne symptôme → cause issue de Step 3 angle 1>

END_FINDING_CONTEXT -->
```

The `FINDING_CONTEXT` block is **mandatory** and stays embedded in the ticket description (Linear preserves HTML comments). [bap-post-deploy-verify](../bap-post-deploy-verify/SKILL.md) reads it from the ticket description after the PR is merged + deployed. Without the block, the verifier returns `verdict: "no-finding-context"` and the loop stays open.

If the finding was passed to you with a pre-computed `hash`, use it verbatim. Otherwise compute it as `sha256(kind + "|" + title + "|" + first_code_ref_or_run_id)` so two findings on the same root cause produce the same hash.

Capture the ticket identifier (`BAP-<n>`) and URL (`https://linear.app/heybap/issue/BAP-<n>`) returned by `save_issue`. You will use both in the next steps.

**Attach every screenshot in `evidence.screenshots` to the ticket.** For each local file path captured in Step 2 (or provided by the user in chat), run:

```
upload  = mcp__linear__prepare_attachment_upload({ issueId: "<ticket uuid>", filename: "<basename>", contentType: "image/png" })
# PUT the file bytes to upload.uploadUrl using the headers returned by prepare
mcp__linear__create_attachment_from_upload({ issueId: "<ticket uuid>", assetUrl: upload.assetUrl, filename: "<basename>", title: "Repro screenshot" })
```

Record each returned `attachment.url` into `evidence.screenshotAttachments[]`; Step 10 cites them in the Slack post. If a screenshot path is in `/var/folders/.../T/` or another temp location, copy it to `~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/` first so the upload doesn't race with cleanup.

If `evidence.screenshots` is empty (purely backend bug, Step 2 was skipped, user pasted nothing), skip this substep. Do not invent screenshots.

Title rules:
- Match the convention from recent merged PRs in `the-agentic-company/bap`: `<Area>: <verb> <object>`. Check `gh pr list --state merged --limit 10` if unsure.
- Under 70 chars.
- No em-dashes anywhere.
- Do not prefix the Linear ticket title itself with `BAP-<n>`; Linear adds the identifier on display.

## Step 7 — implement the fix on a branch

On the local clone:

```bash
cd /tmp/bap-investigation   # or wherever the clone lives
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b fix/bap-<n>-<short-slug>     # or feat/bap-<n>-<short-slug> for features
```

Slug rules: kebab-case, ≤4 words, derived from the bug noun (e.g. `chat-column-collapse`, `audio-attachment-size`, `coworker-postmessage-listener`). The `bap-<n>` prefix lets Linear's GitHub integration auto-attach the branch + PR.

**Implement the QUICK FIX, nothing more.** Constraints:

- Smallest possible diff. One or two files.
- No refactor, no unrelated cleanup, no defensive coding for cases that cannot happen, no comments explaining the fix (the ticket description and PR body explain).
- No new abstractions for hypothetical future use.
- If the durable fix is large (new hook, new endpoint, new component), it does NOT go in this PR. Mention it in the ticket's "Fix durable" section for follow-up.
- For **feature requests**: if the implementation is larger than ~50 lines, open a **draft** PR with the smallest scaffold and a detailed TODO list in the body. Do not autonomously ship a 500-line feature without review.

**Pre-commit regression sweep (mandatory)**: before staging the change, re-open each caller from Step 3 angle 2 and confirm the contract still holds. Then run the full local test suite for the touched packages:

- if the change touches `apps/web/`: `cd apps/web && bun run test:integration` (vitest, scoped to that package).
- if the change touches `packages/core/`: `cd packages/core && bun run test:unit`.
- if both: `bun run test:ci` from the repo root.
- always run `cd apps/web && bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint` (oxlint) on the touched files.

Observe a green pass before staging. If a test breaks unexpectedly, do not edit the test to make it pass; treat the breakage as new evidence that the fix is wrong and return to Step 4 to pick a different alternative. If the local run is red, fix the cause; do not push and rely on CI to catch it.

Commit with a Bap-style message that references the ticket:

```
<Area>: <verb> <object> (BAP-<n>)

<one paragraph: what changed and why, with file:line refs>
```

Areas seen on the repo: `Web`, `Sandbox`, `Skills`, `Core`, `Agents`, `Chat`. Pick the most fitting.

## Step 7.5 — capture the AFTER screenshot (Playwright, UI changes only)

For any UI change, capture an "after" screenshot on the feature branch the same way Step 2 captured the "before". Save to `~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/after.png`, frame the same surface as the before, same viewport size — Baptiste and the team need a direct before/after comparison.

Run the same minimal Playwright snippet from Step 2 (different output path and the new fix already applied on disk). Make sure the local dev stack is up; if not, `docker compose -f docker/compose/dev.yml up -d` and `bun run dev` from the repo root, then wait for `localhost:3000`.

Append the path to `evidence.screenshots` with `kind: "after"`. Step 9 attaches it to the Linear ticket and Step 10 cites the Linear asset URL in the Slack post.

Skip for purely backend bugs.

## Step 8 — open the PR

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create \
  --title "BAP-<n> <Area>: <verb> <object>" \
  --base main \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Closes BAP-<n>

## What this PR does
<the quick fix, with the touched file:line>

## Linear ticket
The full context (symptom, root cause, alternatives, FINDING_CONTEXT for post-deploy verify) lives in BAP-<n>: https://linear.app/heybap/issue/BAP-<n>

## Repro
<one line: where to click in https://heybap.com>
EOF
)"
```

For features whose implementation is over ~50 lines, add `--draft`. For bugs and small features, non-draft.

PR title rules:
- Must start with `BAP-<n>` so Linear auto-attaches.
- Then the standard `<Area>: <verb> <object>` from recent merged PRs.
- Under 70 chars total (so the area + verb + object stays concise).
- No em-dashes anywhere.

Capture the PR URL returned by `gh pr create`. You will need it for Step 9.

## Step 9 — update the Linear ticket: status In Review + reassign to Baptiste + attach PR

Once the PR is open, the operator's (Lubin's) work on the ticket is done: he no longer has merge rights on `the-agentic-company/bap`, only Baptiste can review and merge. The ticket must therefore leave Lubin's "assigned to me" queue and land in Baptiste's. Transition status to `In Review` AND reassign to Baptiste:

```
mcp__linear__save_issue({
  id: "BAP-<n>",
  state: "<config.linear.statuses.in_review>",
  assignee: "<config.linear.reviewer_user_id>",      // Baptiste; PR is in his court now
  links: [
    { url: "<PR URL>", title: "PR #<num> — <PR title>" }
  ]
})
```

Linear's GitHub integration usually attaches the PR automatically once the branch lands (because the branch name contains `bap-<n>`). The explicit `links` attachment is a belt-and-braces fallback if the integration is delayed.

`bap-post-deploy-verify` later transitions the ticket from `In Review` to `Live` once Baptiste's merge + the prod deploy are confirmed by the verifier. Assignee can stay Baptiste at that point (he is the historical owner of the merged change).

`links` is append-only, so re-running this step in a retry is safe.

**Attach the AFTER screenshot** captured in Step 7.5 (UI changes only). Same flow as Step 6's BEFORE attachment:

```
upload  = mcp__linear__prepare_attachment_upload({ issue: "BAP-<n>", filename: "after.png", contentType: "image/png", size: <bytes> })
# PUT file bytes to upload.uploadRequest.url with the signed headers
mcp__linear__create_attachment_from_upload({ issue: "BAP-<n>", assetUrl: upload.assetUrl, title: "After fix" })
```

Record the returned `attachment.url` as the AFTER entry in `evidence.screenshotAttachments[]`. Step 10 cites it in the Slack post.

## Step 10 — Slack `#dev` notification (problem + fix + ping Baptiste for review)

Required for every shipped PR. The team relies on this message — not on Linear's auto-broadcast — to know what is ready for review. Skip it and Baptiste does not learn the PR exists until he opens Linear on his own.

Resolve identifiers:

- channel id from `config.yaml` (`slack.dev_channel_id`); if it is the placeholder, fall back to `mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_search_channels({ query: "dev" })` and cache for the session.
- reviewer id from `config.yaml` (`slack.review_user_id`); if missing, fall back to `mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_search_users({ query: "Baptiste" })`.

Body template (Slack mrkdwn):

```
I fixed <user-visible problem in one short sentence — what was observed in the product, not what's in the code; understandable to a non-technical reader>.

<one or two sentences describing the new behavior from the user's POV — what they will see now; compare to the broken state only if it sharpens the contrast; no file names, no prop names, no diff size>.

PR: <PR URL> (commit `<sha-short>`, <lines> lines, <files-touched> files)
Screenshots: <attachment.url #1> · <attachment.url #2>    ← only if evidence.screenshotAttachments is non-empty; one URL per screenshot; Slack auto-unfurls Linear asset URLs
<@<reviewer-id>> ready for your review.
```

Send via `mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_send_message` (channel_id from config).

Constraints:

- Exactly one message per PR. Do not re-post on PR updates; reply in the same thread instead.
- The reviewer ping (`<@U…>`) is required — it is the whole point of the message; remove it and the notification is silent.
- Start with `I fixed ...` — declarative, no emoji prefix, no ticket identifier. The ticket identifier is in the PR URL and the linked attachment; leading with it adds noise for non-tech readers.
- Do not include a `Linear:` link line. The PR is the actionable surface; the Linear ticket is auto-linked from the PR description.
- Both sentences (the problem statement and the new-behavior description) must read as plain product language. No file paths, no React prop names, no diff-style refs. A non-technical reader on the channel should understand what shipped without opening anything.
- Avoid em-dashes (the team's house style).
- The `Screenshots:` line is required whenever `evidence.screenshotAttachments` is non-empty. Drop the entire line when no screenshot was captured — do not write "Screenshots: none".
- Capture the `permalink` returned by `slack_send_message` and include it in the Step 12 return value as `slackPermalink`.
- Slack: prefer the AFTER screenshot URL (the one that proves the fix lands). Include the BEFORE URL only if the contrast is what makes the message readable; otherwise keep the post tight.

## Step 11 — watch CI, fix red until green

Required for every PR opened by this skill. The skill owns the green-up; never leave a red PR open for Baptiste to deal with.

1. **Watch CI.** After the push, poll `gh pr checks <num>` until every check completes. The Bap CI runs oxlint, typecheck (`tsgo`), Fallow audit (CRAP / dead-code / dupes), gitleaks, react-doctor, and `bun run test:ci` (vitest unit + integration).

2. **If any check is red: fix it, do not abandon.** Read the failure log with `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, identify the root cause, fix in code on the SAME branch (do not close + reopen), commit, push, and watch again. Loop until green. Common gates:
   - Fallow CRAP score at or above threshold → extract a small helper to drop the function's cyclomatic.
   - oxlint `curly` → braces around `if` bodies.
   - typecheck error → match the existing signature.
   - vitest failure → re-read Step 4, the fix is probably wrong.
   Never bypass with `--admin`, `--no-verify`, or by commenting-out the gate.

3. **When CI is green, stop here.** The operator (Lubin) no longer has merge rights on `the-agentic-company/bap`; **only Baptiste merges**. The skill's contract ends at "PR opened, CI green, Slack #dev pinged Baptiste at Step 10." Do NOT call `gh pr merge`. Do NOT trigger any deploy workflow. The Slack post from Step 10 is the handoff; Baptiste reviews + squash-merges from GitHub when he is ready.

4. **Post-merge cleanup is owned by `bap-post-deploy-verify`**, not by this skill. Once Baptiste merges and the staging / prod deploy lands, the verifier reads the FINDING_CONTEXT off the Linear ticket and confirms the fix in prod. This skill exits at "CI green."

## Step 12 — return to the user

Output exactly three blocks, no commentary, no headers:

1. The Linear ticket: `BAP-<n>  <ticket URL>`.
2. The PR URL.
3. The Slack permalink from Step 10.

Screenshots are already attached to the Linear ticket and referenced in the Slack post (Step 6 + Step 10) — no manual upload to mention to the user.

If the dedup step (Step 5) stopped you, output instead:
- `Already covered by: BAP-<n> <ticket URL>` (or the existing PR URL if no ticket exists yet)
- The draft ticket description you would have shipped, so the user can update the existing ticket / PR.

## Historical bugs (anchors)

Use as sanity checks if the current bug sounds similar:

- **`bap:agentic-app-prompt` button works in chat, not in coworker output** → asymmetry. Listener at `apps/web/src/components/chat/agentic-app-panel.tsx:110-183`, missing in `apps/web/src/routes/agents/-components/coworker-info-panels.tsx` (AgenticAppFrame L283, iframes L384 + L404) and in the prototype variant. Fix: extract listener into a shared hook, wire on both surfaces, force `onSendPrompt` to post into `run.conversationId`.
- **Attaching m4a / mp3 in run chat does nothing** → not a MIME filter. Silent 10 MB cap: `apps/web/src/components/prompt-bar.tsx:56` + L319 `.filter(...)` without toast. Dup pattern in `chat-input.tsx:17/123` and `inbox-create-input.tsx:24/81`. Compounding: attachments base64 in orpc body (+33%). Sandbox already at 50 MB (`packages/core/src/server/services/sandbox-file-service.ts:25`). Durable fix: get binary out of JSON body, transport agnostic.
- **Chat column collapses to 0% in coworker info view, no restore** → regression. `apps/web/src/components/ui/dual-panel-workspace.tsx:130-147` sets `isLeftPanelCollapsedByDrag = true` past the 25% threshold, L191-204 forces width 0%, flag never reset on pointerup. Only `coworker-info-page.tsx:482` and `:743` opt in via `allowLeftPanelDragCollapse`. Regression commit: `679c7fd6`.

## What NOT to do

- Do not push to `main`. Always a branch + PR.
- Do not implement the durable fix if it is larger than a small diff. It belongs in the follow-up section of the Linear ticket and PR body.
- Do not add comments in the code explaining the bug. The Linear ticket and PR body are the explanation.
- Do not assume Vercel / S3 / specific vendors unless the repo already uses them.
- Do not claim something is broken without a `file:line` proof.
- Do not use em-dashes anywhere (commit message, PR title, PR body, Linear ticket).
- Do not skip Step 10's Slack `#dev` notification. The team relies on the explicit problem + fix summary and the Baptiste ping to know what is ready for review; Linear's auto-broadcast alone is not enough.
- Do not drop the `<@reviewer-id>` ping from the Slack message. Without it, the post is silent and the review never starts.
- Do not leave screenshots as local paths in the ticket description when `evidence.screenshots` is non-empty. The Step 6 attachment substep must run and the Slack post (Step 10) must cite the resulting URLs. Telling the user to upload manually defeats the automation.
- Do not open the PR before the Linear ticket. The ticket identifier needs to be in the branch + title.
- Do not skip the FINDING_CONTEXT JSON block. The post-deploy verifier depends on it to close the loop.
- Do not skip Step 3's parallel-subagent fan-out, even on "obvious" bugs. The cost of one wasted research pass is 30 seconds; the cost of one wrong fix shipped is hours of regression. The 5 angles are mandatory.
- Do not pick the first plausible fix in Step 4. Enumerate 2 to 3 alternatives grounded in Step 3 and pick on the rubric (reuse > extend > additive > smallest surface). The "Alternatives considérées" section must be real, not retrofitted.
- Do not introduce a new abstraction, hook, service, or file when Step 3 angle 1 returned an adjacent implementation. Reuse the adjacency or explain why it does not fit.
- Do not edit a test to make it pass after the fix. A test break is evidence the fix is wrong; return to Step 4 and pick a different alternative.
- Do not call `gh pr merge` from this skill. Lubin no longer has merge rights on `the-agentic-company/bap`; Baptiste is the only person who merges. The contract stops at "CI green + Slack #dev pinged Baptiste."
- Do not trigger any deploy workflow (`release-main.yml`, `prod-release.yml`) from this skill. Deploys are owned by Baptiste post-merge.
