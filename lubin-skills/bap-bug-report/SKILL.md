  Deeply analyse a bug or feature request in the Bap repo
  (the-agentic-company/bap). Investigation is **mandatory and exhaustive**:
  Step 3 fans out 5 parallel subagents (Agent tool, general-purpose / Explore)
  over symptom-to-root-cause walk, caller graph, adjacent implementations,
  test contract, and git history before any code is written. Step 4
  enumerates 2 to 3 grounded alternatives and picks the one that
  minimises new code (reuse existing abstractions, no new files,
  additive over contract-modifying). Then implements the smallest fix
  on a branch, opens a Pull Request (targeting `main`), waits for GitHub
  CI to be fully green, waits for Greptile to reach a `5/5` confidence
  score, iterates on the same branch until both gates pass, and only then
  posts a structured message in Slack `#pr-lubin` plus a GitHub PR
  comment pinging `@baptistecolle` for review. No Linear ticket is
  created for SIMPLE findings — the PR + Slack post + GitHub ping are the
  full handoff. Screenshots are evidence only: never commit them or attach
  them as PR files/comments; include them only in the PR description. Use
  when the user
  describes a bug or feature gap in Bap / HeyBap (chat, coworker output,
  attachments, MCP, skills UI, run flow…) and wants the best-shaped fix
  proposed as a PR-ready change without manual copy-paste.
  Triggers: "Bug: …", "Feature: …", "ouvre un ticket pour …",
  "open a PR for …", "audit the bug …".
  **Do not invoke directly.** This skill is a leaf of the Phase 2 dispatch.
  Route through `feature-bug-complexity-classification` (or the `/phase-2`
  slash command, or `scripts/submit-finding.sh`). Direct invocation skips
  the classification grid (SIMPLE vs COMPLEX-SCOPED vs COMPLEX-FUZZY),
  which silently produces wrong routing. The only exception is an
  explicit operator override.

# Bap bug / feature → PR handoff

Goal: the user gives a short one-line bug or feature description; you investigate the Bap codebase in depth; you **implement the fix on a branch in `the-agentic-company/bap` and open a Pull Request targeting `main`**. No Linear ticket is created for SIMPLE findings.

After the PR is open, the workflow waits for GitHub CI to turn fully green and for Greptile to return a `5/5` confidence score. If either gate fails, it fixes the issue on the same branch, pushes again, and repeats. Only when both gates pass does it send the `#pr-lubin` Slack handoff and add a GitHub PR comment pinging `@baptistecolle`. Screenshots are evidence only and belong in the PR description, never in the git diff, committed files, or PR comments.

## Repo & context (always)

- GitHub: https://github.com/the-agentic-company/bap
- Owner: `the-agentic-company`.
- CTO: Baptiste. The user (Lubin) is Chief of Staff at Hyperstack/CmdClaw and uses Bap heavily as a power user.
- Linear team: **Bap** (key `BAP`), workspace `heybap` (https://linear.app/heybap).
- Codebase layout (monorepo):
  - `apps/web/` — Next.js frontend (chat, coworker UIs, prompt bar, attachments, settings).
  - `packages/core/` — server services (sandbox, file service, orpc routers like `generation.startGeneration`, `coworker.trigger`).
  - Two recurring UI surfaces matter and are often asymmetric:
    1. **Chat panel** (`apps/web/src/components/chat/…`).
    2. **Coworker run output** (`apps/web/src/routes/agents/-components/coworker-info-panels.tsx`) + the prototype variant `apps/web/src/routes/prototype/coworker/info/-components/coworker-info-prototype.tsx`.
  - MIME validation for skill / coworker documents: `apps/web/src/server/storage/validation.ts` (separate from chat attachments).
  - Sandbox file limit: `packages/core/src/server/services/sandbox-file-service.ts`.
- PR conventions on this repo (look at recent merged PRs to confirm):
  - Title format: `<Area>: <verb> <object>` (e.g. `Web: fix coworker builder chat scrolling`, `Sandbox: fix coworker APP_URL sync`, `Skills: enable imports by default`). Do not prefix SIMPLE findings with a Linear identifier.
  - Branch format: `fix/<slug>` for bugs, `feat/<slug>` for features (e.g. `fix/chat-scrolling`). No Linear identifier in the slug — SIMPLE findings have no ticket.
  - Default branch is `main`.

## Step 1 — get a fresh local clone

Check first whether a recent clone already exists:

```bash
ls -d /tmp/bap-* 2>/dev/null
```

If yes, `cd` in and `git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull`. Otherwise:

```bash
gh repo clone the-agentic-company/bap /tmp/bap-bug-$(date +%s)
```

The local clone is mandatory: this skill writes a fix on a branch and pushes it.

## Step 2 — reproduce the bug live in Chrome (preferred) or Playwright (fallback)

For any UI / UX / layout / interaction / visual bug, **reproduce the issue live and capture a "before" screenshot before concluding**. Static code reading alone misses half the picture (overflow, z-index, layout collapse, hover states, transition glitches, race conditions on load).

**Primary path — Chrome MCP (Claude in Chrome extension).** The operator (Lubin) keeps a Chrome browser signed in on `http://localhost:3000` against his own dev server running out of `<config.local_dev.bap_main_checkout>` (`/Users/lubin.danilo/bap/bap` by default). The skill drives that browser directly — no auth fixture needed, no headless context. This is the path to use whenever the dev stack is up and the Chrome MCP server is reachable.

Pre-conditions:

1. `curl -sf -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" <config.local_dev.dev_server_url>` returns `200`. If not, ask the operator to start the dev stack (`docker compose -f docker/compose/dev.yml up -d` + `bun run dev` from `<config.local_dev.bap_main_checkout>`) and re-poll. If still down after the prompt, fall back to Playwright (next subsection).
2. Operator's main checkout is on a branch where the bug reproduces (usually `main`). Probe with `git -C <config.local_dev.bap_main_checkout> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. If the current branch is not `main` and the bug requires `main`, ask before any switch — never mutate the operator's working tree at this step.

Chrome MCP repro flow:

```
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate({ url: "<config.local_dev.dev_server_url>/<bug-path>" })
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__screenshot({ })  // wide shot of the broken surface
# Save the returned image bytes (base64 in the tool result) to ~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/before.png
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__read_console_messages({ })    // silent JS errors
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__read_network_requests({ })    // 4xx / 5xx / unexpected payloads
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__get_page_text({ })            // anchor the symptom in plain text (a missing toast, a wrong redirect target, etc.)
```

When the bug requires interaction (click, type, drag) to surface, drive it via `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__computer` / `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__form_input` BEFORE the screenshot. The screenshot must show the bug, not just the page on which it would happen.

Record three artefacts:

- `evidence.symptomAssertion` — one sentence describing what to LOOK FOR to know the bug is present (e.g. "the workspace switch lands on `/` instead of `/agents`", "the dropzone shows a red error toast 'fichier trop volumineux'", "the chat input's send button stays disabled"). Step 7.5 will use this verbatim to assert the symptom is GONE after the fix.
- `evidence.symptomObserved` — what Chrome actually showed during this repro (URL, visible text, console line, network response). Confirms the assertion is grounded.
- `evidence.screenshots[]` with `{ kind: "before", path: "~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/before.png" }`.

Screenshots are review evidence only. Never commit them to the repo, never add them to the PR diff, and never attach them as PR comments. Reference them only from the PR description.

**Fallback path — Playwright (autonomous loop only).** When Chrome MCP is unavailable (operator AFK, extension disconnected, Phase 2 running headless via `claude -p` without a live browser), fall back to the Playwright snippet below. It uses headless chromium against the same `localhost:3000` and an auth fixture (`apps/web/tests/e2e/fixtures/*` or `storage-state.json`):

```ts
import { chromium } from "@playwright/test"
const url = "http://localhost:3000/agents/info/<slug>"
const out = "/Users/lubin.danilo/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/before.png"
const browser = await chromium.launch()
const ctx = await browser.newContext({ storageState: "storage-state.json" })
const page = await ctx.newPage()
page.on("console", m => console.log("console:", m.type(), m.text()))
page.on("requestfailed", r => console.log("requestfailed:", r.url(), r.failure()?.errorText))
await page.goto(url)
await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle")
await page.screenshot({ path: out, fullPage: true })
await browser.close()
```

Record `evidence.verifyMode: "chrome-mcp" | "playwright"` so Step 7.5 mirrors the same path.

Skip the live repro only for purely backend / non-visual bugs (schema migration, MCP server, log-only). Set `evidence.verifyMode = "skipped"` with a one-line justification in the PR description; Step 7.5 then does API-level verification instead of UI verification.

The visual evidence refines the diagnosis. It does not replace the code-level root cause.

## Step 3 — deep codebase research (mandatory, fan out before fixing)

**Non-negotiable.** Picking the first plausible fix and shipping is the failure mode this step exists to prevent. The goal is to find the *best* way to fix the bug or build the feature, with the smallest blast radius and zero new regressions. The first idea is rarely the best one; the codebase usually contains an existing pattern that fits and reusing it beats inventing a new one.

Run this step in **parallel** via the Agent tool. Launch the angles below as separate subagents in a single message (one `general-purpose` or `Explore` agent per angle, briefed self-contained). Each subagent returns a structured report with `file:line` evidence for every claim. The skill aggregates the reports and only then proceeds to Step 4.

### Mandatory angles (each is one subagent)

1. **Symptom → root cause walk.** Start at the symptom (the file the user sees breaking, the failing log line, the missing toast). Trace **backwards** through the call graph until you reach a function whose return value or side effect *fully explains* the symptom. Stop at "this is the line that does it", not at "this looks suspicious". Output: an ordered chain of `file:line` references from symptom to root cause, each with one sentence on what it does.

2. **Caller graph of the change site.** Find every place that calls the function / reads the constant / depends on the behaviour you are about to change. Use `rg`, `ast-grep` if installed, or LSP if Bap is open in an editor. For each caller, note whether the proposed change would break its current contract. **A fix that updates one site and breaks three others is not a fix.**

3. **Adjacent implementations.** Find 2 to 3 places in the same repo where a *similar problem was already solved* (similar shape, different domain). Examples: another orpc router that solves the same validation pattern, another component that already wires the missing listener, another service that already handles the size limit you are about to lift. These are the templates. If none exists, say so explicitly; that is itself a signal that the change is novel.

4. **Test contract.** List every test file under `apps/*/test/`, `packages/*/test/`, `__tests__/`, or matching `*.spec.*` / `*.test.*` that touches the change site or one of its callers. For each, summarise in one line *what behaviour it locks in*. The fix must keep every existing test green; if a test must change, that is a signal of contract change and belongs in the PR body. If the area has zero test coverage, flag it.

5. **History lens (`git log` + `git blame`).** Why does the code look the way it does today? Run `git log --oneline -10 -- <change-site>` and `git blame <change-site>` on the offending line. If a recent commit introduced the symptom, name it. If the code was deliberately written this way (a known constraint, a TODO comment, a related PR description), respect that intent or call it out before overriding it.

Run angles 1-5 **concurrently** in a single Agent tool call message (5 subagent invocations in parallel). Wait for all to return before proceeding. If any angle returns "nothing found", do not silently skip; record it explicitly so Step 4 knows what evidence is missing.

### Synthesise (after subagents return)

Produce three things, in this order:

- **Root cause statement**: one paragraph, file:line anchored, derived from angle 1 + angle 5.
- **Constraints map**: what the fix MUST preserve (test contract, caller assumptions, deliberate prior design choices from angle 5). One bullet each.
- **Pattern match**: is there an existing adjacent implementation (angle 3) the fix can reuse? Name it. If yes, the fix is a *replication / extension*; if no, the fix is *novel* and you must justify why no existing pattern fits.

### Systematic coverage check (still required, in addition to the angles above)

1. Frontend filters / validation — `accept=`, MIME whitelists, size caps, silent `.filter(...)` drops, dropzone configs.
2. Client → server boundary — orpc routers, payload serialization (`dataUrl` base64 in JSON body is a known cost center).
3. Server services — sandbox limits, storage validation.
4. Surface asymmetry (chat vs coworker, prod vs prototype) — Bap's most common bug shape.
5. UX feedback — silent drops with no toast / error.
6. **DO NOT assume Vercel, S3, Cloudflare, etc.** Bap is **not** on Vercel. Frame body-limit / runtime claims as "any host body limit", not vendor-specific.

## Step 4 — design the fix, honestly (alternatives ordered, simplest first)

Before committing to a fix, **enumerate 2 to 3 alternative approaches** grounded in the research from Step 3 and **rank them in priority order** (the iteration loop in Step 7.5 walks down this list — alt #1 first, then #2 if #1 fails Chrome MCP verification, then #3 if #2 fails). Each alternative must:

- Be technically possible given the constraints map.
- Touch a different surface or use a different abstraction (so the comparison is real, not cosmetic — same alternative with cosmetic phrasing is one alternative).
- Carry an honest trade-off line: what does it cost that the others do not (lines, surfaces touched, test churn, regression risk, performance, learning curve for the next person reading it).

**Ranking rubric** (priority 1 = top, gets implemented first):

1. **Reuses** an existing abstraction from Step 3 angle 3 (no new code).
2. **Edits one site** rather than two (when the constraints map allows).
3. **Lifts a constant** or wires a missing listener over restructuring a module.
4. Keeps **every caller's contract** unchanged (Step 3 angle 2).

The alternatives **list** (`pickedAlternatives = [alt1, alt2, alt3]`) is the iteration list. Step 7.5 picks alt1 first, falls back to alt2 if verification fails, etc. If only 1 alternative is genuinely defensible (e.g. a literal one-line typo fix with no other shape), say so explicitly — the iteration loop then has only one attempt and exits to the FAILED template if it doesn't verify. **Do not pad the list with strawmen** to make the loop look richer; honest 1-alternative cases happen and the loop handles them.

**Anti-complexification rules** (apply to every fix, no exceptions):

- No new abstraction (function, hook, service, type) unless an existing one demonstrably cannot be reused.
- No new file unless the existing files cannot host the change.
- No defensive code for cases that cannot happen given the call graph (Step 3 angle 2). Trust the boundaries you traced.
- No comments explaining the bug in the code itself; the PR body owns that.
- No unrelated cleanup. The diff is for the bug at hand, not for the codebase at large.
- No "while I am here" refactor. Open a separate ticket for it if the urge is real.

Produce:

- **Quick fix** (the 10-minute unblock). This is what the PR will implement. Often: raise a constant, replace a silent `.filter()` with a toast, add a missing listener, copy a hook from the working surface to the broken one.
- **Durable fix** (the structural property). Goes in the PR body as a follow-up note, not as code. Describe the **property** the fix should have, not a specific transport / vendor.
- **Alternatives considered**: 2-3 bullets from the enumeration above, one line each + the trade-off + why you didn't pick it.
- **Implications**: which other surfaces / hooks / constants get touched, migration concerns, data impact.
- **Regression risk**: for each caller from Step 3 angle 2, one line stating "no change to contract" or "contract changes in this way; mitigated by …". If any caller is *not* covered by an existing test, flag it as `test gap`.

## Step 6 — skipped for SIMPLE findings

SIMPLE findings do not create a Linear ticket. Proceed directly to Step 7.

(Linear tickets are created only for COMPLEX-SCOPED findings via `bap-feature-brainstorm`, which owns that flow.)

## Step 7 — implement the fix on a branch (one iteration of the verify loop)

Step 7 + Step 7.5 form a loop: implement alt #1 → push → verify in Chrome MCP → on FAIL roll forward to alt #2, re-implement on the SAME branch (new commit), re-push, re-verify. The loop exits when verification PASSES, or when `pickedAlternatives` is exhausted, or when iteration cap `config.local_dev.max_verify_iterations` (default 3) is reached. Only the terminal state triggers Step 8 (PR-open / update) and the post-PR gate + handoff in Steps 10-12.

Iteration bookkeeping (record at the start of each attempt):

```json
{
  "iterations": [
    { "n": 1, "alt": "alt1 label", "commitSha": "abc1234", "verifyResult": { "passed": false, "observed": "..." } },
    { "n": 2, "alt": "alt2 label", "commitSha": "def5678", "verifyResult": { "passed": true,  "observed": "..." } }
  ]
}
```

On the local clone — **iteration 1**:

```bash
cd /tmp/bap-investigation   # or wherever the clone lives
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b fix/<short-slug>     # or feat/<short-slug> for features
```

On **iterations 2+**: stay on the same branch. Before implementing the new alternative, **revert the previous iteration's commit** so the working tree is clean for the new approach (otherwise iter 1's stale edits leak into iter 2's final state):

```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit       # "Revert iter N-1" appears as its own commit; clean history, no force-push
```

The PR is opened only at terminal state (Step 8). Mid-loop, the branch lives on GitHub but no PR exists yet — Baptiste isn't pinged until the loop exits successfully. The iteration log in the PR description records which alternatives were tried.

Slug rules: kebab-case, ≤4 words, derived from the bug noun (e.g. `chat-column-collapse`, `audio-attachment-size`, `coworker-postmessage-listener`). No ticket prefix — SIMPLE findings have no Linear ticket.

**Implement the alternative for THIS iteration** (`pickedAlternatives[iteration - 1]`), nothing more. Constraints:

- Smallest possible diff. One or two files.
- No refactor, no unrelated cleanup, no defensive coding for cases that cannot happen, no comments explaining the fix (the PR description and PR body explain).
- No new abstractions for hypothetical future use.
- If the durable fix is large (new hook, new endpoint, new component), it does NOT go in this PR. Mention it in the PR description's "Fix durable" section for follow-up.
- For **feature requests**: if the implementation is larger than ~50 lines, open a **draft** PR with the smallest scaffold and a detailed TODO list in the body. Do not autonomously ship a 500-line feature without review.

**Pre-commit regression sweep (mandatory)**: before staging the change, re-open each caller from Step 3 angle 2 and confirm the contract still holds. Then run the full local test suite for the touched packages:

- if the change touches `apps/web/`: `cd apps/web && bun run test:integration` (vitest, scoped to that package).
- if the change touches `packages/core/`: `cd packages/core && bun run test:unit`.
- if both: `bun run test:ci` from the repo root.
- always run `cd apps/web && bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint` (oxlint) on the touched files.

Observe a green pass before staging. If a test breaks unexpectedly, do not edit the test to make it pass; treat the breakage as new evidence that the current iteration's alternative is wrong — the verify loop in Step 7.5 will pick the NEXT alternative. If the local run is red, fix the cause; do not push and rely on CI to catch it.

Commit with a Bap-style message that references the surface being fixed. On iterations 2+, the message is prefixed with `(iter N)` so the PR log shows the loop:

```
<Area>: <verb> <object> (BAP-<n>)

<one paragraph: what changed and why, with file:line refs>
```

Areas seen on the repo: `Web`, `Sandbox`, `Skills`, `Core`, `Agents`, `Chat`. Pick the most fitting.

## Step 7.5 — verify the fix end-to-end on localhost (Chrome MCP, mandatory for UI changes)

**This step is the contract.** The skill does NOT post "Fixed, to review" unless this verification passed (or was explicitly skipped with a justified reason). A screenshot alone is not enough — the skill must reproduce the same path that triggered the bug in Step 2 and assert that the symptom is gone.

### A. Branch swap on the operator's main checkout

The fix lives on a feature branch pushed to GitHub (Step 7). To verify against the operator's running dev server (which serves `<config.local_dev.dev_server_url>` out of `<config.local_dev.bap_main_checkout>`), the skill swaps that working tree to the fix branch, lets HMR recompile, runs the verification, then swaps back.

```bash
MAIN="<config.local_dev.bap_main_checkout>"
BRANCH="<fix branch name pushed in Step 7>"

# Capture current state so we can restore it
PREV_BRANCH=$(git -C "$MAIN" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
DIRTY=$(git -C "$MAIN" status --porcelain)
if [ -n "$DIRTY" ]; then
  git -C "$MAIN" stash push --include-untracked --message "bap-bug-report-verify-BAP-<n>"
  STASHED=1
fi

git -C "$MAIN" fetch origin "$BRANCH"
git -C "$MAIN" switch "$BRANCH"
sleep <config.local_dev.hmr_wait_seconds>   # let Next.js HMR recompile
```

If any of the swap commands fail (uncommitted merge, locked index, branch not yet pushed), set `verifyResult = { passed: false, skipped: true, reason: "branch-swap-failed: <error>" }` and jump to subsection D (restore). Step 10 will use the SKIPPED template.

### B. Reproduce the same path and assert the symptom is gone

Re-drive the exact path captured in Step 2, on the same URL, in the same Chrome window the operator has signed in. The assertion uses `evidence.symptomAssertion` verbatim — it is the contract between the BEFORE and the AFTER.

```
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate({ url: "<config.local_dev.dev_server_url>/<bug-path>" })
# If the bug required interaction to surface, redrive the same clicks / form_input here.
mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__screenshot({ })  # save bytes to ~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/after.png
afterText  = mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__get_page_text({ })
console    = mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__read_console_messages({ })
network    = mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__read_network_requests({ })
```

Evaluate the assertion against `afterText` / `console` / `network`. Examples:

| `symptomAssertion`                                                  | Pass criterion (the symptom is GONE)                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "workspace switch lands on `/` instead of `/agents`"                | current URL ends with `/agents` (or `/agents/...`), not `/`                         |
| "dropzone shows a red error toast 'fichier trop volumineux'"        | no `.toast--error` in `afterText`, no `413` / `payload too large` in `network`      |
| "chat send button stays disabled after typing"                      | `button[data-action='send']` has no `disabled` attribute after `form_input` typed   |
| "skill_add returns ok=true but the skill is missing from coworker"  | `coworker_get` (Bap MCP) lists the skill in `skills[]`                              |

The assertion check is plain code (string match on the text, regex on the URL, structural check on the DOM via `mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__find` / `inspect`). Do not let an LLM "judge" the screenshot.

Record the outcome:

```json
{
  "verifyResult": {
    "passed": true | false,
    "skipped": false,
    "assertion": "<verbatim from evidence.symptomAssertion>",
    "observed": "<one sentence: what Chrome actually showed>",
    "afterScreenshot": "~/HeyBap Pipeline/artifacts/BAP-<n>/after.png",
    "consoleClean": true | false,
    "networkClean": true | false
  }
}
```

Append the path to `evidence.screenshots` with `kind: "after"`.

### C. If verify FAILED — do not lie to Baptiste

If `verifyResult.passed === false` (the symptom still reproduces after the swap, or the expected fix evidence is missing): **iterate on the next alternative** before declaring failure.

The iteration controller (this is the outer loop around Step 7 + Step 7.5):

```
iter = current iteration number (1-indexed)
maxIter = min(config.local_dev.max_verify_iterations, len(pickedAlternatives))

if verifyResult.passed === true:
  exit loop → continue to Step 8 (open or update PR) → Step 10 CI + Greptile gate → Step 11 PASS handoff

elif verifyResult.skipped === true:
  exit loop → continue to Step 8 → Step 10 CI + Greptile gate → Step 11 SKIPPED handoff
  (skipped means "couldn't verify", not "fix is wrong" — we still hand off to Baptiste with the explicit caveat)

elif verifyResult.passed === false:
  # roll back this iteration's commit only if it broke local tests; otherwise keep it for the iteration log
  add to the PR-description iteration log draft: "Iteration ${iter}: tried ${pickedAlternatives[iter-1].label}, verify KO. ${verifyResult.observed}"

  if iter < maxIter:
    # try the next alternative
    iter += 1
    GOTO Step 7 (still on the same fix branch, new commit prefix "(iter ${iter})")

  elif iter === maxIter AND a NEW finding emerged during the loop suggesting the bug is COMPLEX-SCOPED:
    # escalate gracefully — the bug isn't really SIMPLE
    invoke bap-feature-brainstorm with the augmented context (original + iteration log)
    note in the PR body that the SIMPLE path was re-classified and link the new brainstorm ticket
    exit (no PR PASS / no Slack post here — the brainstorm skill posts its own)

  else:
    # exhausted alternatives, no escalation candidate — terminal FAILED
    exit loop → continue to Step 8 (ensure PR is in draft state via gh pr ready --undo if needed) → Step 11 FAILED handoff
```

Concretely:

- **Same branch through all iterations.** Each iteration adds one new commit prefixed `(iter N)`; never `git reset --hard` or force-push. The PR's commit log IS the iteration audit trail.
- **Terminal state only.** The PR and downstream handoff surfaces are only updated at loop exit (PASS, SKIPPED, escalated, or exhausted FAILED). Mid-loop, the only side-effect is the local iteration log that will be folded into the PR description.
- **Iteration cap is min(`config.local_dev.max_verify_iterations`, `len(pickedAlternatives)`)**. If only 1 alternative is genuinely defensible (Step 4 said so), the loop has 1 attempt and exits to FAILED if it doesn't verify. If 3 alternatives exist, up to 3 attempts.
- **Escalation trigger.** During iteration, if the failure observation reveals that the bug requires a structural change (new abstraction, schema migration, cross-cutting refactor) that Step 4's alternatives did not predict, ESCALATE rather than continue thrashing. The escape valve invokes `bap-feature-brainstorm` with the new evidence; the PR description notes the re-classification and links to the brainstorm ticket. Lubin re-runs `/phase-2` later if the team picks an option.

### D. Restore the operator's working tree (always — even on failure)

```bash
git -C "$MAIN" switch "$PREV_BRANCH"
if [ "${STASHED:-0}" = "1" ]; then
  git -C "$MAIN" stash pop
fi
```

Run subsection D inside a trap / finally so a thrown error in B does not leave the operator's checkout on the fix branch.

### E. Fallback paths

- **Playwright fallback** (autonomous loop, no Chrome MCP). Same swap + sleep + assertion logic, but the navigation + screenshot + console/network capture happens through the Playwright snippet from Step 2 (different output path). The headless context loses the operator's signed-in session, so use `storage-state.json`.
- **Backend-only fix** (no UI surface). Skip subsections A-D. Verify via `curl` against an API endpoint or via `mcp__bap-local__chat_run` / `coworker_run`, asserting on the response shape. Record `verifyResult.assertion` in plain English just the same.
- **Localhost down** OR **Chrome MCP disconnected** AND **Playwright fixture broken**. Set `verifyResult = { passed: false, skipped: true, reason: "..." }` and continue. Step 10 will use the SKIPPED template, explicitly flagging that nothing was verified — Baptiste then re-runs locally before merging.

## Step 8 — open or update the PR (terminal step of the verify loop)

Only runs after the verify loop in Step 7.5 has exited (PASS, SKIPPED, or exhausted FAILED). Mid-loop the branch is pushed but no PR exists yet.

The PR body carries **all the deep-research artefacts**: cause racine, alternatives **tried during the loop**, callers, tests, régression, and the screenshot evidence. The PR description is the ONLY place screenshots belong: do not commit them, do not attach them to the PR as files, and do not post them as GitHub comments.

PR state on open:

- **PASS** terminal → open as **ready** (default `gh pr create`). The workflow will then run the CI + Greptile gate in Step 10 before any Slack post or GitHub ping.
- **SKIPPED** terminal (couldn't verify) → open as **ready** with an explicit "Verified : skipped" callout in the PR body. Baptiste re-runs locally before merging.
- **FAILED** terminal (exhausted alternatives, none verified) → open as **draft** (`gh pr create --draft`). Slack will post "Vérif KO, à reprendre" pinging Lubin in Step 11. Baptiste does not get pinged on a broken PR.

**Anti-duplicate check (mandatory before `gh pr create`)**: check if a PR is already open for this branch. If yes, update it with `gh pr edit` instead of creating a new one.

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>

# Check for an existing open PR on this branch
EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr list \
  --repo the-agentic-company/bap \
  --head "<branch>" \
  --state open \
  --json number,url \
  --jq '.[0]')

if [ -n "$EXISTING_PR" ]; then
  PR_NUMBER=$(echo "$EXISTING_PR" | jq -r '.number')
  PR_URL=$(echo "$EXISTING_PR" | jq -r '.url')
  # Update the existing PR title and body
  gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" \
    --title "<Area>: <verb> <object>" \
    --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Symptôme
<une ligne en langue produit, ce que voit l'utilisateur>

## Cause racine
<2-4 lignes, ancrées sur file:line, chaîne symptôme → cause issue de Step 3 angle 1>

## Ce que fait cette PR
<1 paragraphe + file:line touché ; référencer le pattern adjacent réutilisé (Step 3 angle 3) si applicable>
EOF
)"
else
  gh pr create \
    --title "<Area>: <verb> <object>" \
    --base main \
    --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Symptôme
<une ligne en langue produit, ce que voit l'utilisateur>

## Cause racine
<2-4 lignes, ancrées sur file:line, chaîne symptôme → cause issue de Step 3 angle 1>

## Ce que fait cette PR
<1 paragraphe + file:line touché ; référencer le pattern adjacent réutilisé (Step 3 angle 3) si applicable>
EOF
)"
  PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url --jq '.url')
fi
```

For features whose implementation is over ~50 lines, add `--draft` to `gh pr create`. For bugs and small features, non-draft.

PR title rules:
- Standard `<Area>: <verb> <object>` from recent merged PRs (`gh pr list --state merged --limit 10`).
- Under 70 chars.
- No em-dashes anywhere.
- No `BAP-<n>` prefix — SIMPLE findings have no Linear ticket.

Capture `$PR_URL` for Step 10.

## Step 9 — skipped for SIMPLE findings

SIMPLE findings have no Linear ticket to update. Proceed directly to Step 10.

## Step 10 — post-PR gate: CI green + Greptile `5/5`

**This step is MANDATORY**. Once the PR exists, the skill does not hand off immediately. It must wait for every GitHub CI check to finish green, then wait for Greptile to review the latest head SHA and reach a `5/5` confidence score. If either gate fails, the skill fixes the issue on the SAME branch, pushes again, and restarts the gate.

Required for every shipped PR. The team relies on the post-gate handoff, not on "PR opened", to know what is truly ready for review.

1. **Watch CI first.** After the push, poll `gh pr checks <num>` until every check completes. The Bap CI runs oxlint, typecheck (`tsgo`), Fallow audit (CRAP / dead-code / dupes), gitleaks, react-doctor, and `bun run test:ci` (vitest unit + integration).

2. **If any check is red: fix it, do not abandon.** Read the failure log with `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, identify the root cause, fix in code on the SAME branch (do not close + reopen), commit, push, and start Step 10 again from the top. Common gates:
   - Fallow CRAP score at or above threshold → extract a small helper to drop the function's cyclomatic.
   - oxlint `curly` → braces around `if` bodies.
   - typecheck error → match the existing signature.
   - vitest failure → re-read Step 4, the fix is probably wrong.
   Never bypass with `--admin`, `--no-verify`, or by commenting-out the gate.

3. **Trigger Greptile on every new push, then wait for the latest head SHA.** After every new push to the PR branch, immediately post a PR comment containing exactly `@greptileai` so Greptile reruns on the latest head commit:

```bash
gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "@greptileai"
```

Once the trigger comment is posted, poll the PR review surface until Greptile has posted its notes for the current head commit. Do not send Slack and do not ping Baptiste before Greptile has responded to the latest revision.

4. **Greptile is a hard gate at `5/5`.** If Greptile's confidence score is below `5/5`, address the notes on the SAME branch, push again, post a fresh `@greptileai` comment, and restart Step 10 from CI. Do not hand off a PR with Greptile at `4/5` or below, even if CI is green.

5. **Exit Step 10 only when both gates pass.** The terminal success state is: GitHub CI fully green and Greptile confidence `5/5` on the latest head SHA. Only then continue to Step 11.

## Step 11 — Slack `#pr-lubin` notification + GitHub PR comment

**This step is MANDATORY**. Without the Slack post and the GitHub PR comment, Baptiste doesn't learn the PR is actually ready and the contract is not fulfilled. The skill is NOT done at "PR opened" — it is done at "CI green + Greptile `5/5` + Slack permalink captured + GitHub comment posted".

Required for every shipped PR. The team relies on this message — not on Linear's auto-broadcast — to know what is ready for review. Skip it and Baptiste does not learn the PR exists until he opens GitHub on his own.

Resolve identifiers:

- channel id from `config.yaml` (`slack.pr_channel_id`); if it is the placeholder, fall back to `mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_search_channels({ query: "pr-lubin" })` and cache for the session.
- reviewer id from `config.yaml` (`slack.review_user_id`); if missing, fall back to `mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_search_users({ query: "Baptiste" })`.

The Slack body template is **conditional on `verifyResult` from Step 7.5 after Step 10 has succeeded**. Three variants:

### Variant 1 — PASS template (verifyResult.passed === true)

```
Fixed, to review <@<reviewer-id>> <PR URL>
_<PR title>_
<problème en 1-2 phrases, langue produit>
<fix en 1-2 phrases avec file:line touché>.
Verified : ✅ <verifyResult.assertion>. <verifyResult.observed>
```

Concrete example:

```
Fixed, to review <@U0A87JNV8QP> https://github.com/the-agentic-company/bap/pull/51
_Web: land on coworker list after workspace switch_
Switching workspace from the sidebar dropdown (or from workspace settings) currently bounces the user to the public landing at /. For an established user toggling between workspaces, the expected destination is the coworker list.
Two-line change: navigate({ to: "/" }) to navigate({ to: "/agents" }) in app-sidebar.tsx:478 and settings/workspace.tsx:152.
Verified : ✅ workspace switch lands on /agents. Chrome MCP on the fix branch redirected to /agents/info/scoop-monitor as expected.
```

### Variant 2 — SKIPPED template (verifyResult.skipped === true)

When verification could not run (localhost down, Chrome MCP disconnected, backend-only fix, etc.). The line gives Baptiste the explicit reason so he knows to re-run locally before merging.

```
Fixed, to review <@<reviewer-id>> <PR URL>
_<PR title>_
<problème en 1-2 phrases, langue produit>
<fix en 1-2 phrases avec file:line touché>.
Verified : skipped (<verifyResult.reason>). À retester avant merge.
```

### Variant 3 — FAILED template (verifyResult.passed === false && !verifyResult.skipped)

When verification ran and the symptom still reproduces on the fix branch. The fix didn't fix — the post must NOT claim "Fixed, to review". Ping Lubin (operator), NOT Baptiste — Lubin re-investigates first.

```
Vérif KO, à reprendre <@<operator-id>> <PR URL>
_<PR title>_
<problème en 1-2 phrases, langue produit>
<tentative en 1-2 phrases avec file:line touché>.
Verified : ❌ <verifyResult.assertion>. <verifyResult.observed>. PR laissée en draft.
```

The `<operator-id>` is `config.slack.operator_user_id` (Lubin, `U0AT7378GSX`). Baptiste does NOT get pinged on a broken fix.

Send via `mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_send_message` (channel_id from config — same `#pr-lubin` channel for all three variants).

Mandatory call sequence:

```
result = mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_send_message({
  channel_id: "<config.slack.pr_channel_id>",
  text: "<composed body above>"
})
if result.ok != true OR result.permalink is null:
  # retry once with the same payload (transient API errors are common)
  result = mcp__aa816864-db59-4de1-a375-68c8cccbfe71__slack_send_message({ channel_id, text })
if result.ok != true OR result.permalink is null:
  # do NOT pretend success; surface the error in Step 12's return
  slackPostFailed = true
  slackPostError  = result.error or "no permalink returned"
else:
  slackPermalink = result.permalink
```

After the Slack post succeeds, add a GitHub PR comment that explicitly pings `@baptistecolle`, for example:

```bash
gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "@baptistecolle CI is green and Greptile is 5/5 on the latest head SHA. This PR is ready for review."
```

Retry once if the comment fails transiently. Capture the comment URL with:

```bash
gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json comments --jq '.comments[-1].url'
```

The return value (Step 12) must carry either `slackPermalink` OR `slackPostFailed: true` with the error, and either `githubCommentUrl` OR `githubCommentFailed: true` with the error. Never leave either handoff side effect implicit.

Constraints:

- Exactly one message per PR (top-level, no thread reply). On a re-run, the skill detects the existing message via `slack_search_public({ query: "<PR URL>", limit: 5 })` and skips reposting; thread updates do not re-ping Baptiste.
- Line 1 prefix is the action label that tells the reader, in 4 words, what to do. PASS = `Fixed, to review` (ping Baptiste). SKIPPED = also `Fixed, to review` (still Baptiste's queue, just unverified). FAILED = `Vérif KO, à reprendre` (ping Lubin, not Baptiste).
- The ping (`<@U…>`) is what triggers a Slack notification; removing it makes the post silent. Baptiste on PASS / SKIPPED, Lubin on FAILED.
- The PR URL on line 1 is the actionable link. The italic PR title on line 2 reinforces "PR is open, just review the diff."
- No ticket reference line — SIMPLE findings have no Linear ticket.
- Both descriptive sentences (problem + fix) carry `file:line` references for the bridge between the PR diff and the symptom.
- Avoid em-dashes (team house style).
- The `Verified:` line is **mandatory** in every variant. The PASS / SKIPPED / FAILED prefix tells Baptiste (or Lubin, in the FAILED case) what the verification status is at a glance — Linear and Slack are both noisy, the verdict must be inline.
- Do not include screenshots in the Slack body. Keep screenshots only in the PR description.
- The Slack channel id `C0BCH5L6PQS` (`#pr-lubin`) and the reviewer user id `U0A87JNV8QP` (Baptiste) are pinned in config. Resolve via `slack_search_channels` / `slack_search_users` only if the config placeholder is unchanged; otherwise use the configured ids directly.
- The GitHub comment must only be posted after Step 10 succeeds. Do not ping `@baptistecolle` before CI is green and Greptile is `5/5`.
- After each new push to the branch, post a separate PR comment containing exactly `@greptileai` before waiting for Greptile's refreshed score. Do not assume Greptile rescans automatically.

## Step 12 — return to the user

Output exactly three blocks, no commentary, no headers:

1. The PR URL.
2. The Slack permalink from Step 11, **or** `SLACK POST FAILED: <error>` if Step 11's retry also failed. Never silently omit this block.
3. The GitHub PR comment URL from Step 11, **or** `GITHUB COMMENT FAILED: <error>` if the ping could not be posted.

If `slackPostFailed: true` or `githubCommentFailed: true`, the operator must complete the missing handoff manually before the PR can be considered handed off. The skill flags this loudly rather than pretending the run succeeded.

## Historical bugs (anchors)

Use as sanity checks if the current bug sounds similar:

- **`bap:agentic-app-prompt` button works in chat, not in coworker output** → asymmetry. Listener at `apps/web/src/components/chat/agentic-app-panel.tsx:110-183`, missing in `apps/web/src/routes/agents/-components/coworker-info-panels.tsx` (AgenticAppFrame L283, iframes L384 + L404) and in the prototype variant. Fix: extract listener into a shared hook, wire on both surfaces, force `onSendPrompt` to post into `run.conversationId`.
- **Attaching m4a / mp3 in run chat does nothing** → not a MIME filter. Silent 10 MB cap: `apps/web/src/components/prompt-bar.tsx:56` + L319 `.filter(...)` without toast. Dup pattern in `chat-input.tsx:17/123` and `inbox-create-input.tsx:24/81`. Compounding: attachments base64 in orpc body (+33%). Sandbox already at 50 MB (`packages/core/src/server/services/sandbox-file-service.ts:25`). Durable fix: get binary out of JSON body, transport agnostic.
- **Chat column collapses to 0% in coworker info view, no restore** → regression. `apps/web/src/components/ui/dual-panel-workspace.tsx:130-147` sets `isLeftPanelCollapsedByDrag = true` past the 25% threshold, L191-204 forces width 0%, flag never reset on pointerup. Only `coworker-info-page.tsx:482` and `:743` opt in via `allowLeftPanelDragCollapse`. Regression commit: `679c7fd6`.

## What NOT to do

- Do not push to `main`. Always a branch + PR.
- Do not implement the durable fix if it is larger than a small diff. It belongs in the follow-up section of the PR body.
- Do not add comments in the code explaining the bug. The PR body is the explanation.
- Do not assume Vercel / S3 / specific vendors unless the repo already uses them.
- Do not claim something is broken without a `file:line` proof.
- Do not use em-dashes anywhere (commit message, PR title, PR body, Linear ticket).
- Do not skip Step 11's Slack `#pr-lubin` notification. The team relies on the explicit problem + fix summary and the Baptiste ping to know what is ready for review; Linear's auto-broadcast alone is not enough.
- Do not drop the `<@reviewer-id>` ping from the Slack message. Without it, the post is silent and the review never starts.
- Do not include screenshots anywhere except the PR description when `evidence.screenshots` is non-empty. Never commit them, never add them to the PR diff, and never post them as GitHub comments or Slack attachments.
- Do not create a Linear ticket for SIMPLE findings. Tickets are owned by `bap-feature-brainstorm` for COMPLEX-SCOPED findings only.
- Do not open a new PR if one already exists for this branch. Use `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open` first; if a PR exists, update it with `gh pr edit` instead.
- Do not target a base branch other than `main`. Always pass `--base main` to `gh pr create` and verify with `gh pr view`.
- Do not skip Step 3's parallel-subagent fan-out, even on "obvious" bugs. The cost of one wasted research pass is 30 seconds; the cost of one wrong fix shipped is hours of regression. The 5 angles are mandatory.
- Do not pick the first plausible fix in Step 4. Enumerate 2 to 3 alternatives grounded in Step 3 and pick on the rubric (reuse > extend > additive > smallest surface). The "Alternatives considérées" section must be real, not retrofitted.
- Do not introduce a new abstraction, hook, service, or file when Step 3 angle 1 returned an adjacent implementation. Reuse the adjacency or explain why it does not fit.
- Do not edit a test to make it pass after the fix. A test break is evidence the fix is wrong; return to Step 4 and pick a different alternative.
- Do not call `gh pr merge` from this skill. Lubin no longer has merge rights on `the-agentic-company/bap`; Baptiste is the only person who merges. The contract stops at "CI green + Slack #pr-lubin pinged Baptiste."
- Do not trigger any deploy workflow (`release-main.yml`, `prod-release.yml`) from this skill. Deploys are owned by Baptiste post-merge.
- Do not ping `@baptistecolle` in a GitHub PR comment before GitHub CI is green and Greptile is `5/5` on the latest head SHA.
- Do not treat Greptile `4/5` as good enough. The gate is explicitly `5/5`; if it is lower, iterate again on the same branch.
- Do not forget the `@greptileai` comment after a new push. Without it, you may be reading a stale Greptile score from the previous head SHA.
- Do not post the PASS template (`Fixed, to review`) when `verifyResult.passed === false`. The fix did not fix; the post must be the FAILED template pinging Lubin instead. Lying to Baptiste burns his trust in this pipeline within one occurrence.
- Do not skip Step 7.5's Chrome MCP verification when `localhost:3000` is reachable and the bug has a UI surface. Falling back to "screenshot only, no assertion" defeats the point — the symptom must be reproduced post-fix and observed gone before any `Fixed` claim.
- Do not leave the operator's main checkout on the fix branch after Step 7.5. Step 7.5 subsection D restores the previous branch and pops the stash; this MUST run even on a thrown error (use a trap / finally).
- Do not invent the `symptomAssertion` in Step 7.5. It must come from `evidence.symptomAssertion` recorded in Step 2 — the BEFORE assertion and the AFTER assertion are the same sentence, only the truth value flips.
