  Close the feedback loop after a PR has been merged on

  the original finding (the one that triggered the PR) is actually fixed
  in prod, then **transitions the linked Linear ticket (team `Bap`) to
  `Live`** with a verification comment. On regression, opens a new Linear
  ticket via `feature-bug-complexity-classification` (labelled `Regression`, linked back via
  `relatedTo`). Three verification modes, chosen per finding: Mode A
  (re-run the affected coworker via `mcp__bap__coworker_run`, diff the
  logs), Mode B (drive heybap.com via the Claude-in-Chrome MCP, reproduce
  the scenario, capture before/after screenshots), Mode C (run a generated
  Playwright spec in headless Chromium). Default Mode A. Use when a PR
  opened by `bap-bug-report` has been merged and you want autonomous
  validation before declaring the loop closed.

# Post-deploy verification for `the-agentic-company/bap`

The loop that `feature-bug-complexity-classification` and `bap-bug-report` start has, until now, ended at "PR opened + Linear ticket at `In Review`". This skill closes it. After a merge, it goes back into HeyBap (or the bap code paths) and confirms that the original finding is actually gone in prod, then transitions the Linear ticket to `Live` (a completed-type status meaning "shipped and verified").

Without this skill the pipeline ships PRs blind. With it, every PR is paired with a verification step whose verdict is recorded on the Linear ticket, and regressions create a new ticket automatically.

## When to invoke

- A PR opened by `bap-bug-report` has been merged on `the-agentic-company/bap` and the deploy is live.
- An operator wants to spot-check that a recent merge fixed what it claimed to fix.
- A scheduled `/loop` over Linear tickets in `In Review` whose linked PR has been merged but not yet verified.

Do not invoke when:

- The PR has not been merged yet (no point verifying a draft).
- The PR has been merged but not deployed (build still running on bap). Wait for deploy.
- The PR carries no `BAP-<n>` identifier AND no operator-supplied finding context. There is nothing to verify against.

## Input contract

```json
{
  "prUrl": "https://github.com/the-agentic-company/bap/pull/123",
  "linearTicketIdentifier": "BAP-456",
  "findingContext": {
    "hash": "<sha256 of canonical finding form>",
    "kind": "bug | feature",
    "originalDescription": "<one-line>",
    "affectedCoworker": "@username (optional)",
    "affectedSurfaces": ["chat | coworker-output | prompt-bar | settings | ..."],
    "originalRunId": "<bap run id where the finding fired (optional)>",
    "originalEvidence": [
      { "kind": "code_ref | run_id | log_excerpt | screenshot_path", "value": "..." }
    ]
  },
  "modePreference": "A | B | C | auto",
  "options": {
    "perStepTimeoutSeconds": 180,
    "screenshotDir": "/tmp/bap-verify-screenshots",
    "playwrightWorkspace": "lubin-skills/bap-post-deploy-verify/playwright-tests"
  }
}
```

`findingContext` is resolved in this order:

1. Inline in the input.
2. From the linked Linear ticket description (the `<!-- FINDING_CONTEXT … END_FINDING_CONTEXT -->` block written by `bap-bug-report` at Step 6 of its flow). Call `mcp__linear__get_issue({ id: "BAP-<n>" })` and parse the description.
3. From the PR body (legacy fallback for tickets opened before the Linear refactor).

If none of the three yields a context, the skill refuses to run and returns `verdict: "no-finding-context"`. No silent guessing.

`linearTicketIdentifier` is resolved in this order:

1. Inline in the input.
2. From the PR title (it starts with `BAP-<n>` per the `bap-bug-report` convention).
3. From the PR body (the `Closes BAP-<n>` line).

If none yields an identifier, the verifier still runs but skips Step 4's Linear transition and returns `verdict: "verified-without-ticket"` so the operator can attach it manually.

## Step 1 — confirm merge + deploy

```bash
gh pr view <num> --repo the-agentic-company/bap --json mergedAt,state,mergeCommit,baseRefName,headRefName,title,body
```

If `state != "MERGED"`, abort. Return `verdict: "not-merged"`.

Extract `BAP-<n>` from `title` (regex `^BAP-(\d+)`) or from `body` (regex `Closes BAP-(\d+)`). Store as `linearTicketIdentifier`.

Then verify the deploy. HeyBap is not on Vercel (per `bap-bug-report` rule, line 90 of its SKILL.md), so the deploy signal is project-specific. Two paths:

1. **GitHub deployments API**: `gh api repos/the-agentic-company/bap/deployments?ref=<mergeCommit>` and check the latest `state == "success"` and `environment == "production"`. Wait up to 10 minutes (poll every 30s) if pending.
2. **Production health probe**: `curl -sf https://heybap.com/api/health` (or whichever endpoint the bap repo exposes; grep `apps/web/src/routes/api/health` for the canonical path). If the response includes a commit SHA, compare against `mergeCommit`.

If after 10 minutes the deploy has not landed, return `verdict: "deploy-pending"` and post a Linear comment on the ticket (`mcp__linear__save_comment({ issueId: "BAP-<n>", body: "Deploy pending after 10 min, will retry in 60 min." })`) so the team is notified without spamming. A human can re-trigger later.

## Step 2 — pick the validation mode

Default is Mode A. The skill switches to B or C based on the finding context:

| Trigger | Mode |
|---------|------|
| `findingContext.affectedSurfaces` contains any of `chat`, `coworker-output`, `prompt-bar`, `settings`, `panel`, `attachment-ui` | B (Chrome MCP, visual repro required) |
| `findingContext.kind == "feature"` AND `affectedCoworker` is set AND no UI surface listed | A (re-run coworker, diff logs) |
| `modePreference == "C"` OR a Playwright spec named `<finding-hash>.spec.ts` already exists in `playwrightWorkspace/` | C (Playwright headless, reuse existing spec or generate one) |
| Otherwise | A |

`modePreference: "auto"` runs this matrix. `modePreference: "A" | "B" | "C"` forces. The skill logs the chosen mode in its return value so reruns are reproducible.

## Step 3A — Mode A: re-run the affected coworker

The cheapest, most deterministic mode. Used when the finding was a coworker-side bug or a backend fix and the coworker exists in the workspace.

```ts
// 1. Pull the original run's input (if available)
const original = findingContext.originalRunId
  ? await mcp__bap__coworker_logs({ runId: findingContext.originalRunId })
  : null;
const replayInput = original?.run?.triggerPayload?.userInput
  ?? "[MODE TEST] post-deploy verify of <one-line description>";

// 2. Re-run with the same payload
const run = await mcp__bap__coworker_run({
  reference: findingContext.affectedCoworker,
  userInput: replayInput,
});

// 3. Poll until terminal
const newLog = await pollUntilTerminal(run.id, options.perStepTimeoutSeconds);
```

**Diff logic**:

- If `original` exists: compare `original.events` length / types / errorMessage vs `newLog.events`. Specifically check that the failure pattern that triggered the finding (e.g. `tool_calls.notion.create_page.count == 0`, `errorMessage contains "stopped making progress"`) is no longer present in the new logs.
- If `original` does not exist: assert the new run completed without error AND every `successCriteriaRef` from the finding's coworker spec passes (re-use the eval engine from `bap-coworker-test-loop`).

Return `verdict: "verified"` only if both: (a) the original failure pattern is absent in the new logs, (b) no NEW failure pattern appeared. Else `verdict: "regression"`.

## Step 3B — Mode B: Chrome MCP visual repro

Used when the finding lives in the UI. Drives a real Chrome session against https://heybap.com.

```ts
// 0. Ensure the live PR's commit is what is rendering
await mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate({ url: "https://heybap.com" });
// (verify by inspecting a build-id meta tag or by reading the network response from /api/health)

// 1. Reproduce the original scenario step-by-step
// Steps come from findingContext.originalEvidence or, if not present,
// from a short prose recipe also embedded in the Linear ticket description

for (const step of reproSteps) {
  await execute(step);  // mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__navigate / find / form_input / etc.
  // Light wait for animations / SSE
}

// 2. Capture the current state
const wide = await mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__preview_screenshot({ fullPage: true });
const zoomed = await mcp__Claude_in_Chrome__preview_screenshot({ /* zoom on the offending element */ });

// 3. Diff against the original screenshot (if any)
// Visual diff: pixel-perfect not required; we look for the absence of the
// original symptom (broken layout, missing toast, infinite spinner)
```

**Decision**:

- If `originalEvidence[].kind == "screenshot_path"` is present and points to a file that still exists locally: compute a structural diff (compare DOM trees and the offending element's bounding box / computed style). If the symptom is gone (no more 0% width, toast now visible, button now clickable), verdict `verified`.
- If no original screenshot: rely on a checklist from the finding context. Each item is a boolean assertion the operator (or `bap-bug-report` itself when filing) wrote: "after click X, the email modal opens"; "the attachment uploads at 15 MB"; "the panel does not collapse to 0% on drag". All pass → `verified`. Any fail → `regression`.

Save all screenshots under `options.screenshotDir` and reference them in the return value.

## Step 3C — Mode C: Playwright headless

Used for stable, repeatable scenarios that should run in CI on every future commit, not just this verification. Reuses the pattern that already lives in `vault/projects/li-seo/qa-visual/` (Playwright + Python pilot script).

Two sub-cases:

### 3C.1 — A spec already exists for this finding

`lubin-skills/bap-post-deploy-verify/playwright-tests/<finding-hash>.spec.ts` is present (committed in a previous verification cycle). Run it:

```bash
cd lubin-skills/bap-post-deploy-verify
npx playwright test playwright-tests/<finding-hash>.spec.ts \
  --reporter=json \
  --output=/tmp/bap-verify-playwright-<finding-hash>
```

Parse the JSON reporter output. `verdict: "verified"` if all tests pass; `regression` if any fail.

### 3C.2 — No spec yet, generate one

When this finding has never been Playwright-tested, the skill generates a spec from `findingContext.originalEvidence` + `reproSteps`:

```typescript
// playwright-tests/<finding-hash>.spec.ts (generated)
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Finding <hash>: <one-line>", () => {
  test("symptom no longer present after merge", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(process.env.HEYBAP_URL ?? "https://heybap.com");
    // ...steps generated from reproSteps...
    // ...assertions generated from successCriteria / checklist...
  });
});
```

Commit the spec to the FDK repo (`git add playwright-tests/<finding-hash>.spec.ts && git commit -m "test(post-deploy): add spec for finding <hash>"`). It becomes a permanent regression test, runnable in CI by anyone.

Reuse setup:

- `playwright.config.ts` at `lubin-skills/bap-post-deploy-verify/`. Single project Chromium headless. `baseURL: process.env.HEYBAP_URL || "https://heybap.com"`. Storage state (auth cookies) loaded from `~/.heybap-playwright-auth.json` (gitignored).
- Auth bootstrap: a one-off `npx playwright codegen https://heybap.com --save-storage=~/.heybap-playwright-auth.json` run by the operator the first time. Documented in the skill's README, not in this SKILL.md.

## Step 4 — verdict + actions

Possible verdicts and actions:

| Verdict | Linear actions | GitHub actions |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `verified` | Comment on the ticket with the verification details (mode used, new run id or screenshot paths, Playwright report path). Then transition the ticket to `Live` (`mcp__linear__save_issue({ id: "BAP-<n>", state: "<live_status_id>" })`). | Comment on the PR (`gh pr comment <num> --body "..."`) summarising the verification. Add label `post-deploy-verified` to the PR for idempotency. |
| `regression` | Invoke `feature-bug-complexity-classification` with `kind: "bug"`, title `(Regression) merge of BAP-<n>: <original description>`, evidence including new logs / screenshots / Playwright report. The router dispatches to `bap-bug-report` (or `bap-feature-brainstorm` if the regression is structural), which creates a new Linear ticket. Then comment on the original ticket: `Regression detected: see BAP-<new>` and leave its status as `Live` if it was already there, otherwise as `In Review`. The new ticket is linked via `relatedTo` automatically by passing it in the `save_issue` call. | Label the PR `post-deploy-regression`. Comment on the PR with a link to the new Linear ticket. |
| `no-finding-context` | No-op. | Stop. Notify the operator (return-to-user) that neither the input, the Linear ticket description, nor the PR body carries the FINDING_CONTEXT block. Suggest re-opening the PR via `bap-bug-report` with the context, or invoking this skill with the context inline. |
| `deploy-pending` | Comment on the ticket: `Deploy pending after 10 min, retrying in 60 min.` Schedule a re-invocation (`/loop` pattern, see "Autonomous mode" below). | No-op. |
| `not-merged` | No-op. | Stop. Return-to-user: PR is not merged. |
| `flake` | Comment on the ticket: `Flake detected (different failure pattern). Operator review needed before close.` Do not transition status. Do not open a regression ticket. | Label the PR `post-deploy-flake`. |
| `verified-without-ticket` | No-op (no ticket to update). | Same as `verified` (PR comment + label). Return-to-user surfaces the missing Linear identifier so the operator can attach manually. |

The Linear comment body for `verified` looks like:

```markdown
Post-deploy verified by `bap-post-deploy-verify` (mode <A|B|C>).

- mergeCommit: <sha>
- newRunId: <bap run id>          (Mode A)
- screenshots: <paths>             (Mode B)
- playwrightReport: <path>          (Mode C)

Ticket transitioned to `Live`.
```

## Step 5 — return to caller

Structured return value:

```json
{
  "verdict": "verified | regression | no-finding-context | deploy-pending | not-merged | flake | verified-without-ticket",
  "prUrl": "...",
  "mergeCommit": "...",
  "modeUsed": "A | B | C",
  "linearTicketIdentifier": "BAP-456",
  "linearTicketUrl": "https://linear.app/heybap/issue/BAP-456",
  "linearCommentUrl": "...",
  "linearNewTicketForRegression": "BAP-789",
  "newRunId": "<bap run id if Mode A>",
  "screenshotPaths": ["..."],
  "playwrightReport": "/tmp/...",
  "prCommentUrl": "...",
  "diagnosticNotes": "<1-2 lines for the human if verdict != verified>"
}
```

## Autonomous mode

This skill is the leaf of the post-merge half of the pipeline. To run it autonomously over a fleet of recent merges, query Linear directly for tickets that are due for verification:

```
/loop 60m invoke bap-post-deploy-verify on each ticket in BAP whose linked PR is merged but ticket still at `In Review`
```

Concretely the `/loop` wrapper runs every 60 minutes:

```ts
const tickets = await mcp__linear__list_issues({
  team: "BAP",
  state: "In Review",          // status id from config
  updatedAt: "-P3D",            // updated within the last 3 days, captures the merge event
  limit: 50
});

for (const ticket of tickets) {
  const full = await mcp__linear__get_issue({ id: ticket.id });
  // Find a GitHub PR link attachment whose state is MERGED
  const prUrl = pickMergedPrFromAttachments(full);
  if (!prUrl) continue;
  // Check it has not been verified yet by reading existing comments for the
  // "Post-deploy verified by" marker
  const comments = await mcp__linear__list_comments({ issueId: ticket.id });
  if (comments.some(c => c.body.includes("Post-deploy verified by `bap-post-deploy-verify`"))) continue;
  // Run the verifier
  await invoke("bap-post-deploy-verify", { prUrl, linearTicketIdentifier: ticket.identifier });
}
```

A secondary fallback queries GitHub directly to catch PRs whose Linear attachment did not propagate (Linear's GitHub integration is best-effort):

```bash
gh pr list --repo the-agentic-company/bap --state merged --limit 20 --json number,title,mergedAt,labels \
  --search "is:merged merged:>$(date -u -v-24H +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) -label:post-deploy-verified"
```

The 60m cadence balances deploy latency with not waiting too long for verification. Adjust if your stack deploys faster.

Keep the Linear ids in sync with `lubin-skills/feature-bug-complexity-classification/config.yaml` (canonical source).

## Anti-patterns

- Running Mode A on a UI-only finding. The coworker re-run will pass even when the UI is still broken. Pick Mode B or C by surface.
- Generating a fresh Playwright spec every time for the same finding. The point of Mode C is the spec becomes a permanent CI artefact; if it already exists, run it, do not regenerate.
- Closing a finding on a `flake` verdict. Flakes are not validation; surface them, never silently treat them as pass.
- Trusting `gh pr view` for deploy status. Merge != deploy. Always check the deploy signal explicitly (Step 1).
- Posting a regression to Slack without also opening a Linear ticket via `feature-bug-complexity-classification`. The Linear ticket is the unit of work; Slack is a notification surface Linear drives on its own.
- Transitioning the ticket to `Live` before the verification actually passed. `Live` is reserved for verified-in-prod.
- Running this skill on a PR that was not opened by `bap-bug-report` and that has no manually-supplied finding context. The skill is not a generic E2E test runner; without a finding to verify against, the output is noise.
- Letting Playwright auth state expire silently. The skill should fail loud (`verdict: "playwright-auth-expired"`) and ask the operator to re-run `playwright codegen`.
