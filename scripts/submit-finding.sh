# Manual operator-direct entry to Phase 2 of the HeyBap forward-deployment
# pipeline. Use when Lubin notices a bug or wants a feature while using HeyBap
# day-to-day and doesn't want to wait for the pipeline to surface it.
#
# Invokes `claude -p` from the FDK repo root, which picks up
# .claude/settings.json (pre-approved tools) and routes the finding through
# `feature-bug-complexity-classification`. That skill runs the 5-minute
# investigation, the dedup, the classification grid, and dispatches to
# `bap-bug-report` (SIMPLE) or `bap-feature-brainstorm` (COMPLEX) which
# creates the Linear ticket and (for SIMPLE) opens the PR.
#
# Usage:
#   submit-finding.sh bug "Sandbox cache miss: coworker_run is 8s instead of 800ms"
#   submit-finding.sh feature "Add coworker_pin to keep favorites visible across pagination"

You are running the manual operator-direct entry to the HeyBap forward-deployment pipeline. The operator (Lubin) just observed a $KIND in HeyBap and wants it routed through Phase 2. You are autonomous from now until the verdict.

The operator's one-line description:

  $ONE_LINER

Invoke the \`feature-bug-complexity-classification\` skill with this input:

\`\`\`json
{
  "kind": "$KIND",
  "title": "<derive from the one-liner, < 80 chars, focus on the affected surface>",
  "oneLineDescription": "$ESCAPED_ONE_LINER",
  "context": {
    "pipelineStep": "$PIPELINE_STEP",
    "evidence": [],
    "transcriptOrCoworker": "manual-trigger:operator"
  },
  "operatorConfidence": 0.85
}
\`\`\`

Run the gate's full flow without asking for confirmation:
1. Linear dedup search (team Bap, last 60 days, several distinctive tokens from the one-liner).
2. 5-minute investigation in a clone of \`the-agentic-company/bap\` to localize the surface and estimate fix size.
3. Classification on the 12-criterion grid (SIMPLE vs COMPLEX). Default to COMPLEX when in doubt.
4. Dispatch:
   - SIMPLE → \`bap-bug-report\` runs its own 5-subagent deep research, opens the PR, and creates the Linear ticket at status In Review (label Bug or Feature + Dogfooding, assignee Lubin).
   - COMPLEX → \`bap-feature-brainstorm\` produces problem + 3 options + decision question, creates the Linear ticket at status Triage (label Need More Shaping + Bug or Feature + Dogfooding, assignee Baptiste). For capability gaps, Step 3b inside the brainstorm quantifies impact (Grain corpus + past builds + use cases unlocked + verdict) and the ticket carries an Impact section.

Do not stop to ask for permission on any tool call. The .claude/settings.json in this repo pre-approves every tool the gate needs.

Output at the end, in this exact shape:
1. The verdict: dispatched | already-reported | low-confidence | config-missing.
2. The classification (kind + complexity).
3. The downstream skill invoked.
4. The Linear ticket identifier and URL (e.g. BAP-127, https://linear.app/heybap/issue/BAP-127).
5. The PR URL if a PR was opened.
6. A one-sentence summary suitable for the dashboard.
